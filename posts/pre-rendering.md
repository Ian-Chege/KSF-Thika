# Spiritual Growth and Maturity


Sermon by **Senior Pastor Peter Mburu**



♢ Maturity is whereby you can bear Godly fruits and fruits that can last.

♢ What do you need to do for you to attain spiritual Growth?

▪ John 12:24

**Dying to self**

~ This is where you heartily & joyfully make a choice to lay down your own passions, your own plans, and your own thoughts and willingly choose to live God's Way.

~ It's where chose to set your rights aside & choose to serve God's interests.

~ It is where although you have a right to avenge, you choose to forgive.

~ God's desire is that we can become people to whom He can entrust with His vision & program.

**ANOINTING IS FOR THOSE THAT ARE DEAD TO SELF**

- Dying to self means seeing others as always better than you.

	It means giving others a priority.

  
▪ Luke 14:8-26

● A person who is spiritually mature does not give excuses.

 NB: Being mature means taking responsibility.

GOD CAN NEVER ENTRUST YOU IF YOU ARE IRRESPONSIBLE

 The level of your maturity is revealed by how responsible you are to the divine assignments God has given you.

  

● Maturity means loving God in all circumstances/weathers of life.

It means loving God not just for the good things He has done for you but also because of the painful training He takes you through.

● Maturity is taking rebukes with love & an open heart.

● Maturity is taking the ground in your faith.

● If you want to know your level of maturity, measure yourself with the Word of God.

  
**THE WORD OF GOD IS THE DIVINE STANDARD FOR MEASURING THE MATURITY OF MEN**

- Do not measure yourself with men because God might have called you to something greater than them.

NB: There are standards God has set equally for all believers but there are standards He has specifically set for each person.

  

**Mature people ask for the price**

- They ask, what shall cost me to attain this breakthrough?

	 We live in such a generation that does not want to pay any cost but just wants things on a silver platter.
     
Mature people understand that salvation is a battleground.
They always set their lives & their hearts right with God.

~ They take life with all seriousness that God takes it with.

  

● There are dimensions of breakthrough, influence, dominion...you will only receive after attaining a specific level of maturity; Gal 4:1 KJV

  

● Maturity is revealed by the quality of choices & decisions you make.

▪HEB 11:24-25

~ Moses chose to suffer for God rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin which are but for a short while.

  

NB: Having grey hair does not mean you have attained maturity.

  

NB: There's an age you cannot afford to make a mistake because it will cost you forever.

~ There is an age at which a tree cannot be shaped any longer but as long as it is young, it can be straightened.

  

● Maturity means walking in total surrender to God.

▪ Job 13:27

▪ Psa 139:7-12 " Where could I go from your Spirit? Where could I run and hide from your face?

~ It is walking in and behaving in such a way that comes out of a revelation that God is watching all your steps.

  

● Maturity is whereby you seek after & obey the divine leadings.

▪ Jer 10:23: 'O LORD, I know the way of man is not in himself; It is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.'

▪ Isa 30:21

~ Mature people seek divine leading & they are so flexible to God's leading.

  

● Mature people take the lead.

▪ Judges 5:2

~ As a husband take the lead of priesthood in your family.

~ Become the model your family can emulate.

  

● Mature people obey authority.

They walk in obedience.

~ You are mature if you can obey a leader who is younger than you.

  

● Mature people serve & obey without compulsion.

~ They take their responsibilities willingly & with a joyful heart.

~ Mature people are not compelled to pray, fast, or give...they faithfully do what they ought to do.

  

● Maturity comes by training according to the existing standard.

▪Heb 5:12

~ Mature people know the difference between what is good and what is evil.

~ Mature people are entrusted with great & influential assignments.

  

**Maturity activates divine transition & progress.**

SHALOM.
